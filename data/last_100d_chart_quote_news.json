They got into the store by cutting a hole in the bathroom wall of a neighboring store, police said. The National Retail Federation has said organized retail crime is on the rise, growing by more than 26% in 2021. Burglars stole an entire wall of iPhones at an Apple Store outside Seattle after they cut a hole through a bathroom wall of a neighboring establishment, local police said. They got away with more than $500,000 worth of Apple equipment — including around 436 iPhones, and also Apple Watches and other items, police in Lynnwood, Washington, said. The burglars entered the store after it had closed the night of April 2 by cutting a hole in the bathroom wall of a neighboring store called Seattle Coffee Gear, ABC affiliate KOMO reported, citing local police. \"Our front door was locked,\" Eric Marks, Seattle Coffee Gear''s regional manager, told the affiliate. \"They pried our front door open.\" Marks told the station the burglars had cut a 24-inch-by-18-inch hole in the wall to access the back room of the Apple store. \"I had no clue we were so close or adjacent to them,\" he told the station.",

Major banks and airlines open the season in mid-April after a disappointing Q4 that saw S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) fall nearly 4%. The slump is widely expected to worsen in Q1, falling more than 6% year over year, according to research firm FactSet. The definition of an “earnings recession” is when earnings decline two quarters in a row. If analysts are right, we’re about to be in one. What’s the problem? A bunch of things, including the strong dollar, slowing consumer and business demand, tough comparisons versus year-ago earnings, and rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve again tightened the screws at its March meeting. All these factors can slow earnings growth, with some sectors pressured more than others. One thing you probably can’t blame for Q1’s troubles—though it’s likely to have an impact later this year—is the recent banking turmoil.",

When it comes to ultra-short-term trading, nothing trumps liquidity. In that sense, the best cryptos for day trading are highly liquid and generally well-known. The smaller, low-volume cryptos can work during trending markets over a longer holding period. However, for in-and-out scalps, we need liquid cryptos.

Markets will be closed on Friday to mark Good Friday, meaning that investors will have to wait until Monday to trade on important March employment figures. “Bad news in the jobs data – if that’s what it brings early Friday – may be good news from an interest rate standpoint, but a slowing economy isn’t really something that tends to help stocks,” said a note from Charles Schwab.

Although inflation was subsiding for a while, recent data indicates a negative trend. Consequently, the Federal Reserve has reinforced its stance on increasing interest rates and taking action to extinguish the inflationary blaze. Incorporating growth stocks from both large and small businesses is essential for a sound financial portfolio due to their capital appreciation potential over time. I’m going to highlight three growth stocks to buy which have run nicely this year, and suggest why they could have more room to run.

(Fact check: it didn’t) Nevermind that under the stewardship of the central banks, the financial system has lurched from one crisis to the next for decades on end, every one an order of magnitude worse than the prior. The policy response to each crisis (expand credit, suppress interest rates, print money) simply incentivized moral hazard, perverse incentives, and an ever widening wealth gap – while providing the setup for the next crisis.

Major banks and airlines open the season in mid-April after a disappointing Q4 that saw S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) fall nearly 4%. The slump is widely expected to worsen in Q1, falling more than 6% year over year, according to research firm FactSet. The definition of an “earnings recession” is when earnings decline two quarters in a row. If analysts are right, we’re about to be in one. What’s the problem? A bunch of things, including the strong dollar, slowing consumer and business demand, tough comparisons versus year-ago earnings, and rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve again tightened the screws at its March meeting. All these factors can slow earnings growth, with some sectors pressured more than others. One thing you probably can’t blame for Q1’s troubles—though it’s likely to have an impact later this year—is the recent banking turmoil.",

                "summary": "Dividend-paying large-cap stocks are some of the best ways to add wealth to your portfolio. That’s because the company pays you to hold your shares when you have a dividend stock. And that’s true of even the biggest of large-cap stocks. Most dividend-paying large-cap stocks issue payouts on a quarterly or monthly basis. If you are a younger investor, putting those payouts back into the stock makes sense to increase your position and grow your portfolio even faster. Once you get that money, it’s yours to do with as you see fit. But if you’re a retiree, you’re probably more inclined to take those payouts as income to supplement your other retirement accounts. Either way works, and I appreciate a company that cares for its shareholders. I’ve used my Portfolio Grader to evaluate some of the most significant dividend-paying large-cap stocks that would make outstanding choices for any dividend portfolio.

Despite improved sentiment over the past few weeks, mostly because of temporary, macro-related factors , too many negatives remain on the table with GOOG stock. While it is not for certain, there is an upcoming event that could cause a serious price decline for the tech giant’s shares. That would be Alphabet’s upcoming quarterly earnings release. While the company has yet to announce its Q1 2023 earnings date, it’s probably at the end of this month. There are several reasons these results, alongside updates to guidance/outlook could elicit a negative reaction from the market. Existing challenges are likely to continue. More recent changes may intensify. After a pullback, this could keep the stock in an extended slump. GOOG Alphabet $104.28 On Shaky Ground Changing hands today for around $106 per share, it may appear as if the situation with Alphabet is improving.",

For Walmart, leveraging its supply chain to unlock new margin gains is integral to “Everyday Low Cost,” which enables “Everyday Low Prices.” Walmart doesn’t expect to grow fast in 2023. For the year ending Dec. 31, 2022, (Walmart’s fiscal year 2023), Walmart’s U.S. comparable sales grew 6.6% year over year (y/y) and 13% against a two-year stack. But the annual guidance reiterated at Tuesday’s Investment Community meeting in Tampa, Florida, has U.S. comp sales growing just 2 to 2.5% this year. In other words, Walmart expects significantly slower growth this year, though CEO Doug McMillon recommitted to management’s 4% annual sales growth target over the next five years.",

Furthermore, the bearish argument surrounding the travel home rental platform aligns with the woes of last year. Specifically, investment analyst Edwin Dorsey of The Bear Cave newsletter issued a report calling attention to risks underlying ABNB stock. The bulk of the report appears to stand behind a paywall. However, on the free side of the digital barrier, the article concentrates on negative consumer experiences sparking a flight to better (and sometimes cheaper) alternatives.

In fact, according to some speculation , Alibaba is planning on merging its burgeoning AI tool with its popular workplace communication app, DingTalk. While today’s report isn’t particularly tangible, it’s still a clear indicator that ChatGPT’s breakout success is sure to spawn competitors. BABA stock is up about 4% on the news.

The slump is widely expected to worsen in Q1, falling more than 6% year over year, according to research firm FactSet. The definition of an “earnings recession” is when earnings decline two quarters in a row. If analysts are right, we’re about to be in one. What’s the problem? A bunch of things, including the strong dollar, slowing consumer and business demand, tough comparisons versus year-ago earnings, and rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve again tightened the screws at its March meeting. All these factors can slow earnings growth, with some sectors pressured more than others. One thing you probably can’t blame for Q1’s troubles—though it’s likely to have an impact later this year—is the recent banking turmoil.",

In 2020 and 2021, any stock with exposure to electric vehicles, no matter how tertiary, took off with the thought that this time would be different. But in 2023, this is a time to consider EV stocks to sell. Allow me to make my case. Investors would be wise to look at the lessons of the dot-com era. For every legendary name like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ), there were also the Pets.com of the world. The electric vehicle sector has a similar feeling right now. The move to electrification is real, and there’s been too much invested in seeing the world going backward. An inflection point is here. However, at their core, these companies are car companies. That means they are capital-intensive businesses. And their business models are heavily reliant on a supply chain that is still disrupted in areas essential to EV production. That means it’s time to be careful about where you direct your investment capital.",

                "summary": "Green hydrogen is arguably one of the cleanest ways to generate energy, and the current push toward net zero means hydrogen stocks have become a hot commodity. Investing in energy is a simple decision no matter the economic climate. We’ll always need to keep the lights on. How we’ll do that is where opportunity comes a-knocking. As it stands, hydrogen currently makes up about 0.1% of the global energy mix. By 2050, that will need to jump to 10% if we’re to hit net zero. As with most energy stocks , barriers to entry in this field are relatively high, so picking companies with boots already on the ground is a good way to build a position in the industry. For the more conservative among us, choosing a well-diversified stock might be the best option. These companies operate within the industrial gas industry and have plenty of experience with hydrogen.

                "summary": "IANS San Francisco, April 6 After mass layoffs, Amazon now reportedly plans to reduce the number of stock awards for employees in 2025. According to Insider, this move signals a potentially major shift in Amazon''s approach to compensation. Citing an internal memo, the report said that Amazon has told managers that employee stock awards, called restricted stock units or RSUs, for 2025 \"will be reduced due to the economic climate and company budget\". Amazon will reevaluate the 2025 compensation in the first quarter of next year to \"plan for stock variation\". The \"final outlook year\" refers to 2025, given the two-year grant cycle that starts next year, according to the report. The memo also hinted towards a change in Amazon''s pay model that would give staff more cash, \"a change that could make up for any potential weakness in its stock price\". Amazon shares are currently trading at roughly the same levels seen in 2018 and 2020. \"The lack of stock appreciation has caused some employees to complain about the value of their RSU-based compensation.",

But the increase fell short of analyst estimates of 432,000 for the quarter, according to FactSet. A message was left Friday seeking comment from the Austin, Texas-based Tesla on why the prices were cut. Guidehouse Research e-Mobility Analyst Sam Abuelsamid said the company needs to sell more vehicles to keep its factories running at full capacity. “Overhead of underutilized plant eats up (profit) margin extremely quickly,” he said.",

(Fact check: it didn’t) Nevermind that under the stewardship of the central banks, the financial system has lurched from one crisis to the next for decades on end, every one an order of magnitude worse than the prior. The policy response to each crisis (expand credit, suppress interest rates, print money) simply incentivized moral hazard, perverse incentives, and an ever widening wealth gap – while providing the setup for the next crisis. With this unbroken string of failures under their belts, it’s always rich to listen to these insular technocrats, who have zero skin in the game, pontificating about the meltdowns they created.",

The controversial eclectic vehicle (EV) producer has reported multiple positive catalysts in the past month. These types of developments, such as successfully completing deliveries and completing successful pilot programs, would boost a more stable company. But through it all, MULN stock remains firmly in the red, shedding more than 50% since early March 2022. Despite some slight gains as the month ended, Mullen has failed to sustain any positive momentum and seems intent on continuing its race to the bottom. No matter what the company reports, the stock simply can’t demonstrate any sustainable growth. As long as this persists, MULN stock will only appeal to speculative retail traders. That isn’t a recipe for growth, no matter what the r/WallStreetBets crowd might say. What’s Happening With MULN Stock? The short answer to the question posed above is simply: “Not much, and that’s the problem.” MULN stock has tried to rally today, but as of this writing, it is down 0.79% for the day.",

On April 3, Kimbal exercised options to purchase 100,000 shares priced at $24.73 a piece, amounting to a value of about $2.47 million. On the same day, he sold all of the 100,000 shares at prices between $192.78 and $202.64 for a total of $19.57 million, netting him a $17.1 million gain. Usually, Tesla insiders would not be able to sell until the electric vehicle (EV) company reports earnings on April 19. However, Kimbal sold the shares via a prearranged 10b5-1 plan enacted on Dec. 8, 2022, which provides immunity from the blackout period. The sale has generated controversy, as Kimbal’s sales in the past have marked relative tops for TSLA stock. Let’s get into the details. Kimbal Musk Sells $19 Million of TSLA Stock Kimbal’s last sale , which occurred on Nov. 5, 2021, was similar to today’s sale. On that day, he exercised options to receive 25,000 shares of TSLA.",

                "summary": "Last year, investors may have noticed a massive flight of capital took place. Capital moved away from tech, as widespread concerns about rising interest rates caused fear. Semiconductors are integral to the tech sector, and suffer as a consequence. That said, some semiconductor stocks have rebounded, trending upward since late last year. This can be easily seen by looking at various ETFs, such as the iShares Semiconductor (NASDAQ: SOXX ). Still, the semiconductor market remains well below its early 2022 levels, as measured by these indices. So, it’s reasonable to assume that investors could see continued returns in the near-term, as a rebound continues. The EV sector should continue contributing to the growth, and the emergence of AI poses further prospects. Ultimately, investors who play the long game will likely succeed in owning undervalued chip stocks, particularly as growth projections remain robust. Here are the seven top undervalued semiconductor stocks on my watch list now. SWKS Skyworks Solutions $111.35 MXL MaxLinear $33.69 INTC Intel $32.81 ON ON Semiconductor $75.34 AMD Advanced Micro Devices $92.47 NVDA Nvidia $270.37 MRVL Marvell Technology $39.26 Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) sells many products, including amplifiers, attenuators, diodes, modulators, isolators, optocouplers, and phase shifters, among other things.",

That’s because the company pays you to hold your shares when you have a dividend stock. And that’s true of even the biggest of large-cap stocks. Most dividend-paying large-cap stocks issue payouts on a quarterly or monthly basis. If you are a younger investor, putting those payouts back into the stock makes sense to increase your position and grow your portfolio even faster. Once you get that money, it’s yours to do with as you see fit. But if you’re a retiree, you’re probably more inclined to take those payouts as income to supplement your other retirement accounts. Either way works, and I appreciate a company that cares for its shareholders.

Layoffs are continuing to pile up. Jobless claims in the most economically sensitive states are on the rise – and usually, jobless claim spikes in these states precede nationwide claim spikes. At this point, the labor market is obviously deteriorating. However, it’s not yet dying. And that offers a “sweet spot” – a narrow window for the Fed to guide the economy to a soft landing. Adding to our conviction is the fact that financial stress is also high right now. Treasury yields are plunging, indicating that bond investors are preparing for the financial markets to get tight. Credit and yield spreads are widening, and bank lending volume is collapsing. Plus, on Tuesday, JPMorgan ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said that the banking crisis is not over yet – and that’s from someone who endured the 2008 financial crisis, so we’re inclined to heed this warning.",

As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has overtaken markets in 2023, a new chip race has taken shape. Many of the market’s top chip makers have shifted their focus to streamlining semiconductor production, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The Wall Street darling has risen to the top of Silicon Valley and NVDA stock seems poised to keep growing. But recently, one of the sector’s giants issued a bold statement challenging its progress. A lphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) recently provided updates on its AI language model-training supercomputer. And it says that its technology is superior to Nvidia’s. Does this mean that Nvida’s tech won’t ride the AI wave right to the top? Let’s take a look at Google’s statements and assess what investors should be expecting. What’s Happening With NVDA Stock?

All three major indices fell as data showed that employment opportunities in the United States fell in February to their lowest level in nearly two years, indicating that the labor market was cooling, while factory orders fell for the second month in a row. Monday’s data also indicated weak manufacturing activity in the United States. “The number of job vacancies is down, which makes people worry that hiring is going too slowly, and that’s going to be bad for the economy.

Shares of NVDA stock have nearly doubled in just three short months to start the year. That’s some incredible performance and a pace of growth that’s unlikely to continue from here. That said, there’s good reason for this outperformance. Of course, most investors’ interest in chip makers like Nvidia is driven by the industrial uses of these chips. Given that Nvidia is a higher-end producer of GPUs and other key products, growth in areas like artificial intelligence can drive growth over the long term. This has always been the case for Nvidia, which is on the cutting edge of technological innovation. Crypto and gaming might be out, but the cloud and AI are still in. With that said, let’s dive into a few more reasons why I think NVDA stock could continue to outperform this year and beyond.

                "summary": "The Nasdaq Composite just posted its best quarter since 2020. The tech-heavy index jumped 17% as investors started to position for the Federal Reserve potentially pausing its interest-rate increases. Chipmaker Nvidia and social-media giant Meta were the two best-performing Nasdaq stocks in the first quarter. The Nasdaq Composite just wrapped up its best quarter almost three years, powered higher by outsized gains from some of the best-known US tech stocks. The index rallied 17% over the three months ended March 31 for its best returns since the second quarter of 2020, when tech shares rebounded sharply after crashing in the early days of the pandemic. The rally in tech stocks has been fueled mainly by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its interest-rate increases, as it looks to protect financial stability amid banking-sector jitters triggered by the sudden collapse of SVB . Just under 50% of traders now expect the Fed to pause its tightening campaign at its next meeting in May, according to CME Group''s Fedwatch tool – and techs tend to rally when interest rates stop rising because they can borrow at a flat rate, boosting the future cash flows that make up a core part of their valuations.",

Growth stocks are companies that are expected to grow their earnings, revenue or cash flow faster than their peers or the market at large. They tend to be industry pioneers with a disruptive product or service that’s changing the game in a significant way. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a great example of this in the e-commerce space. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is another well-known innovator that changed the way we listened to music and made investors a handsome pile of cash along the way. That said, finding innovative growth stocks is harder than it might sound. For every Amazon or Apple there are tens of dozens of failures whose investors were left with losses. Growth stocks make money for investors because their share price rises as their profits, or expected profits, grow. They tend to be valued more highly than peers because expectations are high. But that means missteps can be costly, and volatility is to be expected.",

Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META ), Alphabet, Inc. ( GOOG ) and Airbnb, Inc. ( ABNB ) are former unicorns. Currently, according to CB Insights , there are 1,208 unicorn companies worldwide.

That would give America''s adversaries more time to catch up, the Pershing Square CEO tweeted. Earlier, Elon Musk and others called for a six-month halt on AI development. There''s no time to lose in the artificial intelligence race, according to billionaire investor Bill Ackman. Apparently in response to an open letter that calls for a six-month break in AI development, the Pershing Square CEO tweeted that this would be detrimental to national security. \"Shutting down AI development for six months gives the bad guys six more months to catch up,\" he wrote . \"Our enemies are working hard to develop their own OpenAI. It would have been a mistake to delay the Manhattan Project and let the Nazis catch up. I don''t think we have a choice.\" Meanwhile, the open letter seeking an AI pause has been gaining traction among tech and academic leaders, and has even been signed by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The signees argue that AI has developed too rapidly, without building safeguards around it.",

                "summary": "The entire stock market is gearing up for a major breakout as investors are becoming convinced that the banking sector has stabilized and that the Federal Reserve is, at the very least, almost done hiking interest rates. Meanwhile, two critical sectors –housing and computer chips — are showing signs of recovery. Many investors are starting to focus on the economy’s strong fundamentals instead of quaking in fear about interest rate hikes. In this environment, there are many potential breakout stocks. The Street gets enamored with certain sectors for several months, and the names within those spaces perform very well during those periods. Therefore, in this article, I will focus on stocks that have not yet broken out to a great extent, even though they are in sectors that are being embraced by “the big money.” Here are seven potential breakout stocks for investors and traders to consider. Potential Breakout Stocks: NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com Many semiconductor stocks have surged recently, as the well-known Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH ) climbed about 10% between March 15 and March 30.",

According to the Chinese news outlet Pandaily , a blogger has discovered a leaked version of Alibaba’s chatbot inside its Tmall Genie smart speaker. This isn’t exactly the first hint of an artificial intelligence project from the Chinese e-commerce giant. Indeed, in February, it was announced that Alibaba was working on its own AI chatbot, akin to OpenAI’s now-famous ChatGPT. In fact, according to some speculation , Alibaba is planning on merging its burgeoning AI tool with its popular workplace communication app, DingTalk. While today’s report isn’t particularly tangible, it’s still a clear indicator that ChatGPT’s breakout success is sure to spawn competitors. BABA stock is up about 4% on the news.

However, passing down a bond-filled portfolio that may underperform inflation in the long term doesn’t sound enticing. Indeed, equities have been the best-performing assets over the very long term, for good reason. Those looking to build generational wealth generally do so in stocks and real estate.

Investors view a recession as more likely following the latest batch of lacklustre US indicators, including a survey showing lower private sector hiring in March and a report indicating easing services sector activity. Though the Institute for Supply Management’s services report was better than a manufacturing survey released earlier this week, “services ended last quarter on a weaker note and we anticipate a deterioration in conditions through the rest of the year”, said Oxford Economics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.34 points, or 0.24%, to 33,482.72; the S&P 500 lost 10.22 points, or 0.25%, at 4,090.38; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 129.47 points, or 1.07%, to 11,996.86. “We may have transitioned from the notion that ‘bad news is good news’ to ‘bad new is bad news’,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive and portfolio manager at InfraCap in New York. “Fear about a recession is the dominant theme.” Reflecting worries about the economy and recent turmoil in the banking sector, interest rate futures imply 61% odds that the Fed will cut interest rates from current levels by the end of its July meeting, according to CME Group''s Fedwatch tool.",

At this point, the labor market is obviously deteriorating. However, it’s not yet dying. And that offers a “sweet spot” – a narrow window for the Fed to guide the economy to a soft landing. Adding to our conviction is the fact that financial stress is also high right now. Treasury yields are plunging, indicating that bond investors are preparing for the financial markets to get tight. Credit and yield spreads are widening, and bank lending volume is collapsing. Plus, on Tuesday, JPMorgan ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said that the banking crisis is not over yet – and that’s from someone who endured the 2008 financial crisis, so we’re inclined to heed this warning.",

Ofcom said technical restrictions and discounts to encourage customers to use a single provider for all their needs even when better quality alternatives were available could also be anti-competitive. “High barriers to switching are already harming competition in what is a fast-growing market,” Ofcom director Fergal Farragher said. “We think more in-depth scrutiny is needed to make sure it’s working well for people and businesses who rely on these services.” The fast-growing, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing business has attracted attention from regulators in Europe as well as Britain.",

                "summary": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is planning its first round of internal job cuts since before the pandemic. Indeed, the iPhone maker is terminating several roles in its corporate retail teams. What do you need to know about the Apple layoffs? Well, it seems the job cuts hammering the tech sector only continue to add more names to the list. Last week, Apple employees were informed via video conference that they had until Friday to apply for new roles within the company. It’s currently unclear how many positions were affected by the “organizational change,” but employees are referring to the move as a layoff. Apple has long been one of the few tech companies slow in making job cuts. Even as the likes of Meta (NASDAQ: META ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) layoff tens of thousands of employees in the face of rising interest rates, Apple has typically opted for alternative ways to rein in costs . This includes delaying bonuses for corporate teams, pushing back specific projects, and cutting budgets across certain teams.",

Apple has also cut engineers and security guards that held contracting roles. Apple told employees that these are not layoffs, but streamlining, and that the changes are aimed at improving the upkeep of stores globally. Those who were cut have the option to reapply for positions similar to their prior job, and those who do not take on a new role could get up to four months of pay.

Specifically, its Bard chatbot ad provided inaccurate information. Furthermore, analysts criticized the company’s AI search event for lacking details on responding to Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) ChatGPT challenge in Feb. Alphabet is in a favorable position, having recently opened Bard to the U.S. and UK public . This development marks a shift from the company’s previous cautious approach. It also shows Alphabet’s efforts to catch up in deploying speculative technologies and capitalize on the momentum in generative AI. Google’s latest move complements its decade-long efforts in AI-enabled innovations. Despite concerns over market share and margin compression, Google’s current discounted stock price and the value of new opportunities generated from implementing generative AI capabilities outweigh the risks and offer potential for future growth.",

In recent days, a number of well-known technology leaders, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed an open letter calling for a pause in the development of generative AI that they say poses high-level risks to humans and society. The strongly worded letter stated: “Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?” The letter, which received considerable media coverage, came on the heels of a research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs that said generative AI could lead to the loss of 300 million jobs globally and replace 7% of the American workforce in the next decade. As the initial hype surrounding chatbots subsides, people are starting to ask hard questions about the implications of AI technology. What’s also becoming clear is that many of the AI stocks that have flourished in recent months have also been over-hyped and are unlikely to live up to the high expectations of investors.",

                "summary": "Since the start of the year, investors have warmed back up to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). AAPL stock has climbed by nearly 30% during this time frame. Although some of its more recent lift may be because of investors cycling back into big tech, as a safe harbor from the banking crisis , rising confidence in the company’s prospects has been the key driver. Following this rally, the question is whether now is a good time to enter/add to a position, or to sit on the sidelines. On one hand, Apple is of course not immune to the tech sector headwinds that are still affecting the other FAANG components. This tech giant may have a stronger chance of reporting better results much sooner, and to a greater extent, compared to its rivals. So, what’s the best move? Let’s dive in and find out. AAPL Apple $164.90 Why AAPL Stock has Outperformed Apple shares have outperformed the broad market (as measured by the S&P 500 ) year-to-date.

                "summary": "BANGKOK (AP) — Oil prices soared more than 5% after Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers said they will cut production by 1.15 million barrels per day from May until the end of the year. Shares in Asia were mixed on Monday and the dollar rose against the Japanese yen. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose $4.14 to $79.81 per barrel, or 5.5%, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose $1.30 to $75.67 per barrel on Friday, ahead of the weekend meeting where members of the so-called OPEC+ group of oil exporting countries decided on the cuts, which are in addition to a reduction announced last October that infuriated the Biden administration. The cuts immediately pushed prices higher and were expected to also lead to higher gas prices, adding to strains in many countries where high fuel prices are a heavy burden. Higher oil prices also will complicate the efforts by central banks to rein in inflation. “This will create both political waves across Europe and even higher general inflation in the USA, leading to renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep hiking rates aggressively,” Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, said in a report.",

Tampa, Florida-based Madelyn Machado, 33, said that during a typical day she would log on around 11 a.m. when her West Coast colleagues would show up for work, sit in meetings from Noon until 3:30 p.m., and then check LinkedIn for an hour before logging off. Ms. Machado, who held a position as a recruiter, says that after joining the company in September 2021, she spent much of her time in meetings that didn’t accomplish anything, and that the parent of Facebook and Instagram had too many recruiters and not enough work for them to do. -WSJ \"We just don’t hire anybody and, like, we still get paid,\" she said in a TikTok video, relaying what she says other recruiters told her, adding that the company didn''t expect her to hire anyone in her first year, given that she was still learning the ropes. \"I do think a lot of these companies wanted there to be work, but there wasn’t enough,\" she said of her six months at the company, which she says fired her for posting career advice on TikTok (and probably all that shit talking).",

Influencers on Facebook and Instagram say they are struggling to get problems resolved, per CNBC. One Instagram influencer told CNBC that her requests for support are going \"into the void.\" Meta''s layoffs have affected its customer service teams and are leaving influencers and businesses on its social-media platforms Facebook and Instagram without adequate support, CNBC reported. The layoffs, which saw thousands of employees leave the company, affected staff in Meta''s client support and customer experience and communities teams, former staff told CNBC. Meta first announced plans to lay off over 11,000 workers in November. It then announced a further 10,000 layoffs in March as part of a major cost-cutting effort. CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained that the layoffs were part of Meta''s \"Year of Efficiency ,\" during which the company will scale back costs after disappointing fourth-quarter results in 2022.",

                "summary": "NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks mostly fell on Wednesday (April 5) following data that showed a weakening US economy, but the Dow advanced on gains by Johnson & Johnson and Walmart. Investors view a recession as more likely following the latest batch of lacklustre US indicators, including a survey showing lower private sector hiring in March and a report indicating easing services sector activity. Though the Institute for Supply Management’s services report was better than a manufacturing survey released earlier this week, “services ended last quarter on a weaker note and we anticipate a deterioration in conditions through the rest of the year”, said Oxford Economics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.34 points, or 0.24%, to 33,482.72; the S&P 500 lost 10.22 points, or 0.25%, at 4,090.38; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 129.47 points, or 1.07%, to 11,996.86. “We may have transitioned from the notion that ‘bad news is good news’ to ‘bad new is bad news’,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive and portfolio manager at InfraCap in New York. “Fear about a recession is the dominant theme.” Reflecting worries about the economy and recent turmoil in the banking sector, interest rate futures imply 61% odds that the Fed will cut interest rates from current levels by the end of its July meeting, according to CME Group''s Fedwatch tool.",

Apple has an economic position of power across markets which gives rise to a scope of action that is not sufficiently controlled by competition. Based on its mobile end devices such as the iPhone, Apple operates a wide-ranging digital ecosystem which is of great importance to competition not only in Germany, but also throughout Europe and the world.

At this point, the labor market is obviously deteriorating. However, it’s not yet dying. And that offers a “sweet spot” – a narrow window for the Fed to guide the economy to a soft landing. Adding to our conviction is the fact that financial stress is also high right now. Treasury yields are plunging, indicating that bond investors are preparing for the financial markets to get tight. Credit and yield spreads are widening, and bank lending volume is collapsing. Plus, on Tuesday, JPMorgan ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said that the banking crisis is not over yet – and that’s from someone who endured the 2008 financial crisis, so we’re inclined to heed this warning.",

Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian Zelbo \"Apple''s announcement event is likely the last hope for convincing investors that the AR/MR headset device could have a chance to be the next star product in consumer electronics,\" Kuo wrote in a Medium article estimating upcoming virtual reality headset sales from Sony and Meta. With Sony cutting production plans for the PS VR2 and an estimated 300,000 product lifecycle shipments for the Meta Quest Pro, Kuo believes there is \"insufficient evidence\" to indicate that AR/VR headsets can become the next major thing in consumer electronics.

                "summary": "Last year, investors may have noticed a massive flight of capital took place. Capital moved away from tech, as widespread concerns about rising interest rates caused fear. Semiconductors are integral to the tech sector, and suffer as a consequence. That said, some semiconductor stocks have rebounded, trending upward since late last year. This can be easily seen by looking at various ETFs, such as the iShares Semiconductor (NASDAQ: SOXX ). Still, the semiconductor market remains well below its early 2022 levels, as measured by these indices. So, it’s reasonable to assume that investors could see continued returns in the near-term, as a rebound continues. The EV sector should continue contributing to the growth, and the emergence of AI poses further prospects. Ultimately, investors who play the long game will likely succeed in owning undervalued chip stocks, particularly as growth projections remain robust. Here are the seven top undervalued semiconductor stocks on my watch list now.

                "summary": "Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is well-known for introducing new, vastly improved, high-end desktop chips. Accordingly, as hardware and data center trends improve, many analysts are expecting INTC stock to rise. My own personal INTC stock price prediction stands at a whopping $85 per share. There are many reasons for this, over and above the aforementioned thesis. Intel could see impressive growth from the surge in interest around artificial intelligence. Additionally, as technological innovation picks up, Intel’s hardware could run into incredible demand. Considering these factors, I remain very bullish on INTC stock. Let’s dive into why this company could have more upside from here. Intel Is Going to Become a Big AI Player In line with my previous predictions , Habana Labs, an Israeli company that Intel acquired in 2019, appears likely to help Intel become a significant player in AI. (The process just took much longer than I expected). At a recent event, Intel reported that its new Xeon chip, working with its “new AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) AI accelerator engine,” was four times more efficient than a competing product from AMD in facilitating the development of some AI capabilities.",

The RecAccel™ N3000 system delivered 1.7x better perf-per-watt for inference DLRM while maintaining 99.9% accuracy leveraging its INT8 calibrator. The RecAccel™ Quad-N3000 PCIe card is expected to increase perf-per-watt 2.2x while also delivering the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). These results give cloud service providers confidence to choose a new solution on existing and future data center platforms. Performance per Watt The RecAccel Quad-N3000 PCIe card is expected to increase perf-per-watt 2.2x more than GPU H100 PCIe. MLPerf™ v3.0 testing was performed on a GIGABYTE G482-Z54 server with AMD EPYC™ 7452 32-core CPU and contained eight RecAccel™-N3000-32G-PCIe cards. During the system testing, the RecAccel™ N3000 performance resulted in nearly 100% scaling across each card. \"We deliver high-performance computing products that help intelligent systems effectively manage complex data sets,\" said Kumaran Siva, corporate vice president, Strategic Business Development, AMD. \"We are extremely proud of the joint work we have done with NEUCHIPS to achieve leadership performance and power efficiency for DLRM inference in MLPerf™ v3.0 using AMD EPYC processors.",

As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has overtaken markets in 2023, a new chip race has taken shape. Many of the market’s top chip makers have shifted their focus to streamlining semiconductor production, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The Wall Street darling has risen to the top of Silicon Valley and NVDA stock seems poised to keep growing. But recently, one of the sector’s giants issued a bold statement challenging its progress. A lphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) recently provided updates on its AI language model-training supercomputer. And it says that its technology is superior to Nvidia’s. Does this mean that Nvida’s tech won’t ride the AI wave right to the top? Let’s take a look at Google’s statements and assess what investors should be expecting. What’s Happening With NVDA Stock?

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) stole market share from Intel while inflation and interest rate hikes generally wreaked havoc on chip stocks. However, it appears that Intel is finally having its turnaround moment. As Intel reasserts itself in a competitive microprocessor market, enterprising investors should consider taking a reasonably sized share position for the long term. What’s Happening With INTC Stock? INTC stock once traded at around $69, but competition from Advanced Micro Devices and other factors brought it down to $25 for a hot minute. A recovery seems to be in progress, though.

Many investors are starting to focus on the economy’s strong fundamentals instead of quaking in fear about interest rate hikes. In this environment, there are many potential breakout stocks. The Street gets enamored with certain sectors for several months, and the names within those spaces perform very well during those periods. Therefore, in this article, I will focus on stocks that have not yet broken out to a great extent, even though they are in sectors that are being embraced by “the big money.” Here are seven potential breakout stocks for investors and traders to consider.

On the other hand, various employment metrics suggest that the economy remains robust, and recent bank bailouts will reinforce optimistic sentiment. As Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal’s chief economics correspondent, says in his recent column , “Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials had considered skipping a rate hike after banking stress intensified last week. And he hinted that Wednesday’s increase could be their last one …” That is likely the case, unless the Federal Reserve wishes to raise rates above the inflation rate.",

But the story-heavy zombie shooter seems to have missed a step in its PC debut, as players decry that the PC port suffers from an all-too-familiar array of performance issues. Valve The day after its official release, the game is sitting at a “Mostly Negative” user rating on Steam . Despite the port’s purported PC enhancements, like an unlocked framerate, ultrawide resolutions, and support for AMD’s FSR 2 upscaling, players are complaining of horrible performance, frequent bugs, freezes, and crashes to the desktop.

Nvidia CTO Michael Kagan, however, recently expressed his belief that cryptocurrencies do not \"bring anything useful for society,\" in an interview from The Guardian. \"All this crypto stuff, it needed parallel processing, and [Nvidia] is the best so people just programmed it to use for this purpose. They bought a lot of stuff, and then eventually it collapsed, because it doesn’t bring anything useful for society. AI does.\" Kagan shares. Kagan also compared crypto to AI, claiming that the uses of processing power for artificial intelligence engines were somehow more \"worthwhile\" than mining or computing for proof-of-work blockchains.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available. As a long-term investor during periods of market volatility like we’re seeing today, there’s one thing I always do. I zoom out to look at the big picture. That way, I can identify technological megatrends that are going to reshape the world over the next decade (regardless of stock market gyrations). Then I buy the stocks on the cutting edge of those megatrends at huge discounts . And then in a few years, I sell those stocks for huge profits. I did this in 2015, when the market was freaking out about plunging oil prices and a global economic slowdown. That same year, I recommended investors buy the dip in an up-and-coming chipmaker called Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). A few years later, AMD stock had soared more than 8,000%. I did this in 2018, when the market was crashing as the Fed was hiking interest rates too aggressively.",

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available. It’s October 1950. Alan Turing, the genius who cracked the Enigma code and helped end World War II, has just introduced a novel concept. It’s called the “ Turing Test ,” and it’s aimed at answering the fundamental question: Can machines think? The world laughs. Machines — think for themselves? Not possible. However, the Turing Test sets in motion decades of research into the emerging field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research is conducted in the world’s most prestigious labs by some of the world’s smartest people. Collectively, they’re working to create a new class of computers and machines that can, indeed, think for themselves . Fast forward 70 years. AI is everywhere. It’s in your phones . What do you think powers Siri? How does a phone recognize your face? It’s in your applications . How does Google Maps know directions and optimal routes?",

And, most importantly, what the situation looks like for JPM stock going forward. Last month, when the failure of SVB Financial’s (OTCMKT: SIVBQ ) Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary set the recent banking crisis into motion, scores of depositors moved quickly. These depositors opened accounts at JPMorgan Chase and other money center banks. Accordingly, many headlines aptly stated that the big banks benefited from the collapse . The narrative is that regional banks (perceived to be more vulnerable) will continue losing customers/deposits to the “too big to fail” institutions. However, will this “big banks are winning, regional banks are losing” narrative help to spur a recovery for this stock, still trading at below pre-crisis price levels? Let’s find out. JPM Stock: Crisis and Opportunity In his latest annual letter to JPM shareholders, Jamie Dimon made his view quite clear on whether the banking crisis is a good or bad thing for big banks such as the one he leads.",

Both suits allege JPMorgan knowingly benefited from Epstein''s sex-trafficking operation, Bloomberg reports. Doe''s legal team is accusing JPMorgan of exploiting the sexual assault claim against Staley in order to force her to provide \"intrusive discovery\" in the course of litigation, and possibly be subject to a deposition by Staley himself (what?). \"The effect of adding him to the suit is to force her to share private medical records and her most intimate communications with one of her abusers,\" wrote Doe''s lawyer, Brad Edwards. \"It also sends a message to other victims that (JPMorgan) will exploit all vulnerabilities of each victim who dares come forward to hold the bank accountable. \" Doe wants the suits to be separated so that JPMorgan can''t force \"her sexual abuser\" back into her life, according to the report.",

It wasn’t the regulatory changes.” Dimon said JPMorgan’s role in providing $30 billion among banks to backstop a run on deposits at First Republic Bank FRC was “an attempt to give them time to resolve the situation” but did not provide additional details. Overall, Dimon said banks should be allowed to go out of business without posting a systemic risk. “Failure is OK — you just don’t want the domino effect,” he said. Dimon said inflation will likely be here for longer than people expect, and that it’s also affecting long-term interest rates which are challenging permanent pools of capital such as sovereign wealth funds.",

Layoffs are continuing to pile up. Jobless claims in the most economically sensitive states are on the rise – and usually, jobless claim spikes in these states precede nationwide claim spikes. At this point, the labor market is obviously deteriorating. However, it’s not yet dying. And that offers a “sweet spot” – a narrow window for the Fed to guide the economy to a soft landing. Adding to our conviction is the fact that financial stress is also high right now. Treasury yields are plunging, indicating that bond investors are preparing for the financial markets to get tight. Credit and yield spreads are widening, and bank lending volume is collapsing. Plus, on Tuesday, JPMorgan ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said that the banking crisis is not over yet – and that’s from someone who endured the 2008 financial crisis, so we’re inclined to heed this warning.",

It is because you can always start thinking about your retirement regardless of age or career stage. Furthermore, exploring stocks for retirement investment can provide an excellent opportunity to analyze some of the most successful companies. Investing for the long term can seem intimidating in today’s fast-paced world. Recent events, such as the pandemic, supply chain, inflation crisis, war in Ukraine, and bank collapses, have left investors uncertain about what to do next. Consequently, everyone is looking for safer investments to ensure stable returns. As a result, buying forever stocks has never looked this good as investors look to avoid a market crash. Concentrating on businesses with established histories of consistent profits and cash flows can be a viable solution. Enterprises that have weathered prior economic downturns are more likely to thrive in the face of future market fluctuations. Moreover, diversifying across various sectors and industries can aid in securing a stable and growing dividend income for investors in the future.",

In an annual letter to JP Morgan’s shareholders, Dimon said last month’s failure of SVB and the Swiss government-brokered takeover of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS had undermined confidence in the banking system, the Guardian reported.”As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come,” he said. Although suggesting that there were marked differences with the 2008 financial crisis, Dimon, who has been the chair and chief executive of JP Morgan since 2006, suggested that the risks to the market had been “hiding in plain sight”, in a swipe at regulators. These risks included exposure to interest rates being raised sharply around the world to tackle soaring inflation. Dimon criticised the US Federal Reserve for failing to incorporate higher borrowing costs into its annual stress tests.",

All three major indices fell as data showed that employment opportunities in the United States fell in February to their lowest level in nearly two years, indicating that the labor market was cooling, while factory orders fell for the second month in a row. Monday’s data also indicated weak manufacturing activity in the United States. “The number of job vacancies is down, which makes people worry that hiring is going too slowly, and that’s going to be bad for the economy. That’s feeding recession fears,” said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at Index IQ in New York.

It has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative.” Even so, it is unclear whether the disruptions will slow the consumer spending that drives the US economy, Dimon wrote.",

The JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) CEO recently addressed the aftermath of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In a letter to shareholders, Dimon lays out why he feels the crisis is far from over. The CEO also says the current situation is far different from the 2008 financial meltdown. Per the letter: “The current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come.” The fact that bank stocks are falling today seems to support to his argument. Will they keep falling in the coming months? Let’s take a look at Dimon’s letter and assess what investors can expect as the dust continues to settle. What’s Happening With Bank Stocks? Many bank stocks closed in the red today as a result of general negative market momentum. JPM stock itself closed down by 1.3% today, on par with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and slightly better than Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).",

                "summary": "While purchasing a stock may seem simple, selecting the correct one without a tried-and-tested approach can be extremely difficult. Therefore, identifying the optimal stocks to acquire presently or monitor requires careful consideration. In times of increased uncertainty, many investors are rightly turning to defensive stocks as a way to play the current market. Unfortunately, defensive stocks are just about as difficult to pick as any other group. Defensiveness is key to many investors, in light of the ongoing aggressive policy stance taken by the Federal Reserve. In a bid to stomp out inflation, the Fed has raised rates at its fastest pace in decades. For growth stocks and other interest rate sensitive areas of the economy, this has been bad news. However, these three companies have held up relatively well and have weathered their fair share of previous crises. Thus, without further ado, let’s dive into three defensive stocks worth buying in April, for those looking to reposition their portfolios.",

JPMorgan is battling two combined lawsuits over Epstein - one from the US Virgin Islands, and another brought by an Epstein accuser known as Jane Doe. The cases have a provisional trial date set for October. Included in the filing is a 2008 email to Mary Erdoes, a 27-year JPMorgan veteran who runs the asset and wealth management division where Epstein was a client. The bank, meanwhile, said in a March filing that Erdoes \"always acted with the highest levels of integrity and professionalism,\" and had \"informed this client 10 years ago that his relationship with our firm was being terminated.\" Erdoes was questioned under oath as part of the pre-trial proceedings.",

Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of the nation’s largest bank, is a veteran of the 2008 financial crisis, and one of the last senior executives remaining at a Wall Street firm since the industry nearly collapsed 15 years ago. Dimon said in his letter there was plenty of blame to go around for Silicon Valley Bank’s failure . The bank’s management poorly handled the bank’s interest rate risk, leaving it too exposed to the Federal Reserve’s rising interest rates, he said. Regulators like the Fed did not adequately understand the risks in SVB’s balance sheet soon enough to push the bank to adjust course before it was too late.",

Although First Republic has stabilized somewhat since Dimon helped lead a joint $30 billion lifeline to the bank through a collaboration of 12 banks, the industry is not completely out of the woods yet, said Dimon, who highlighted the possibility that the Fed will need to keep interest rates high for longer than currently expected.",

He downplayed the claim that the regional banking crisis has favored major banks by attracting deposits and growing their market share. “Any crisis that damages Americans’ trust in their banks damages all banks” and “the notion that this meltdown was good for large banks in any way is absurd,” Dimon said.

US stocks were mostly higher on Tuesday as market volatility continues to recede following last month''s banking crisis. The CBOE Volatility Index fell below the 19 level on Monday, marking its seventh consecutive daily decline. A VIX below its long-term average level of 20 is seen as a low volatility market environment. Helping fuel the decline in volatility are growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive with its interest rate hikes going forward. The CME FedWatch Tool currently forecasts just one more 25 basis point rate hike at its May meeting, followed by a pause in June and a 25 basis point cut in July. By the end of the year, the Fed is currently expected to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points from the current range of 4.75%-5.00%.",

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon weighed in on the US banking turmoil and what it means for the economy in a letter to shareholders released on Tuesday. \"The current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come,\" Dimon wrote in a 43-page annual message that covers a range of topics from the Wall Street bank''s performance and artificial intelligence to geopolitics and regulation in the banking sector. \"It has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative,\" Dimon said, adding it is unclear when the current uncertainties in the banking system will end.",

This follows news that the U.S. finalized a 1.12% cut to Medicare Advantage (MA) rates for 2024. Raymond James analyst John Ransom believes that much of the regulatory policy overhangs in regard to UNH stock have been eased in recent months. Ransom also characterized the MA cut as a “clearing event for the MA providers.” Ransom added that UNH stock may be undervalued following price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple compression. The analyst explained : “We think that the stocks are likely de-risked at current levels and present attractive entry points for defensive stocks with double-digits [long-term] earnings growth algos.” On TipRanks , Ransom has a success rate of 59% and an average annual return of 9.7% for stocks covered. That ranks him as the 343rd Wall Street analyst among 8,382 analysts.",

Additionally, the Fed recently instituted its ninth consecutive rate increase. This 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate hike adds pressure to a financial system already troubled by various banking concerns. Yet, despite all the trouble, markets are up year-to-date, with the S&P 500 up a modest 0.8%. Several growth stocks have proven particularly resilient, providing especially strong returns. There’s some irony there. Higher rates tend to negatively impact growth stocks overall. Last year, this was certainly true, as growth stocks lost significant value. Nevertheless, outliers are continuing to buck conventional wisdom. Let’s look at some of the more prominent names in that conversation.

And the index publisher classifies ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM ) as purely a growth stock. XOM was a cash flow gusher the past two years, but it’s hardly what most people classify as growth. Heck, it sells a product that one day could be no more. In 2023, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: IVE ), which tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Value Index , is up 0.3%. The iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA: IVW ), which, you guessed it, tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Growth Index , is up nearly 5.3%. In other words, growth is back, baby.

Fundamentally, exchange-traded funds offer investors an efficient way to diversify their portfolios. By opening the canvas up to a basket of compelling stocks or bonds, market participants can cover immense ground. Further, covering ground represents a critical need since we don’t know which way the equities sector will head. For instance, so far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 got off to an auspicious start on declining inflation data. However, the most recent print indicates that rising prices remain stubbornly high and above expectations. Therefore, the Federal Reserve may step in more aggressively moving forward. Of course, that wouldn’t be a great backdrop for risk-on-asset classes. However, a select few relevant sectors may benefit. Therefore, the best ETFs make plenty of sense during this ambiguous cycle.

The church holds $44 billion in stocks and is currently being investigated by the SEC for disclosure rules. These are the top 10 holdings of the Mormon Church''s investment portfolio as of December 31. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' sports a $100 billion investment portfolio that includes $44.4 billion invested in stocks. The portfolio is registered with the SEC under the name Ensign Peak Advisors, and the Wall Street Journal reported last week that it''s being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential violations of disclosure rules. The Mormon Church''s investment portfolio wasn''t revealed to the public until 2019, when a former employee of the fund filed a whistleblower complaint, alleging that the fund shouldn''t have tax-exempt status because it doesn''t engage in any charitable activities. Those claims were denied by church officials, and the church has said it is currently complying with the SEC''s investigation into its disclosure practices.",

AP file CVS Health is plunging deeper into primary care services, buying primary care provider Oak Street Health for approximately $10.6 billion. The drugstore chain said Wednesday it would pay $39 per share in cash for each share of Oak Street in a deal expected to close this year. Oak Street runs care centers mostly for lower-to-middle income people with Medicare Advantage plans. Those are privately run versions of the federal government’s program for people aged 65 and older. With its latest acquisition, CVS Health Corp. aims to capitalize on the federal government’s interest in cutting costs and improving the health of people in its Medicare program. The government wants more people in value-based care arrangements, which basically focus on keeping patients healthy and any chronic problems like diabetes under control. The goal: Ward off big medical expenses like hospital stays. In addition to running nearly 10,000 drugstores nationwide, CVS Health also covers more than 3 million people with Medicare Advantage plans through its Aetna arm.",

However, when it comes to picking stocks , it can’t hold a candle to the AI-powered equity ETF run by ETF Managers Group . The company was founded in 2014 when CEO Sam Masucci launched the business to help meet the need for thematic investing. Its first theme-based fund was the ETFMG Prime Junior Miners ETF (NYSEARCA: SILJ ), which debuted in 2012. In May 2021, the ETF exceeded $1 billion in net assets . ETF Managers Group’s AI-Powered Equity ETF (NYSEARCA: AIEQ ) hasn’t quite reached that level. Launched in October 2017, it has net assets of nearly $120 million . The actively managed fund uses the proprietary EquBot quantitative model developed by EquBot to pick U.S.-listed stocks. EquBot uses IBM’s (NYSE: IBM ) Watson supercomputer to do all the heavy lifting. “Each day, the EquBot Model ranks each company based on the probability of the company benefiting from current economic conditions, trends, and world events and identifies approximately 30 to 200 companies with the greatest potential over the next twelve months for appreciation and their corresponding weights, targeting a maximum risk adjusted return versus the broader U.S. equity market,” states the fund’s prospectus .",

One way to identify undervalued growth stocks is to look for companies with high revenue and earnings growth, but low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. A low P/E ratio means that the stock is trading at a lower multiple of its earnings compared to other stocks in the same industry or market. Another way to identify undervalued growth stocks is to look for companies with strong fundamentals such as high return on equity (ROE) and strong balance sheets.
